# hello-world
This repository was made for Code Kentucky coursework. The only thing I currently do that feels similar to coding is using Microsoft Excel to create formulas and macros. Other than that, I remember using Visual Basic back in high school to make a clock with pre-made assets. Through coursework through, Code Kentucky, I will hopefully lead to me diving deeper into more raw coding.
